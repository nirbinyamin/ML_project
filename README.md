# MNIST and User Digit Drawing Classification using CNN and SVM
 
This project focuses on the classification of handwritten digits using two different machine learning approaches: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The main objective is to compare the performance of these models on the popular MNIST dataset, as well as on custom user-drawn digits collected via a graphical user interface (GUI). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix), and visualizations of results.

Through this comparison, the project highlights the strengths and weaknesses of deep learning versus classical machine learning methods for image classification tasks.
